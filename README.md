For the purpose of this initial project 8 menu options reside in the table. The switch method takes the user input from 1-8 and adequately executes a different choice function on the active airfield. For instance, option 1) will List the fleet of Air Craft in the Airfield. The program will exit when the user selects option 8 from the menu.

1) List fleet
2) Fly all jets
3) View fastest jet
4) View jet with longest range
5) Load all Cargo Jets
6) Dogfight!
7) Add a jet to Fleet
